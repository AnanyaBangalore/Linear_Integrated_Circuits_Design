# Linear_Integrated_Circuits_Design
My lab materials for linear integrated circuits (LIC) are stored in this repository. These electrical circuits combine several analogue functions, like oscillators, filters, and amplifiers, onto a single chip. Circuit designs, schematics, and simulation results are all included in the files.

Each lab file is assigned to a particular LIC circuit and contains information about the function, design, and analysis of that circuit. Operational amplifiers, voltage regulators, and phase-locked loops are just a few of the subjects that are covered in the files, which are arranged according to lab session.

In the end, the lab materials offer a thorough introduction to LIC and show how to use them in real-world scenarios. Students and amateurs interested in analogue electronics and circuit design can use them.
